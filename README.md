# InvestmentRanking
A personal project for the ranking of stocks according to parameters discussed by Benjamin Graham in "The Intelligent Investor".

There are currently three types of investor types allowed: Defensive, Aggressive, and Custom

Defensive investors look to receive a respectable ROI while investing minimal time and effort.
This leads defensive investors to lean towards less risky stocks, and those with a proven track record.
Defensive investors value certain fundamentals, such as market value, more than aggressive investors.

Aggressive investors are willing to invest more time and effort in exchange for a greater potential ROI.
Because of this, aggressive investors are usually more willing to take a risk on an unproven company.
Potential growth is highly valued by aggressive investors.

The CustomInvestor class allows the user to determine how heavily each stat will be measured.
There is no typical behavior for a custom investor, as it is very dependent on the user's opinions.

Thanks for taking a look!
